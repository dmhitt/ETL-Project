Then I noticed a picture saying free coffee for members, so naturally I downloaded the app to receive the offer but when I walked up to claim the offer the cashier was on a phone/tablet....I assumed maybe for doordash but it was a few minutes later that she finally asked what I wanted and I pointed to the sign and showed her the corner bakery account I just made and said I don\\u2019t qualify for the offer. She didn\\u2019t look up my account number or anything. Needless to say I will stick to using corner bakery south coast on lunch break than this one.
