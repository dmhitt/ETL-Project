# Yelp API and Google Places API Restaurant Reviews

## Restaurants - Information and Reviews

An Orange county client is interested in opening a new restaurant and hired our team to provide customer review data for market research.

We’ve identified our datasets from Yelp and Google APIs as our data sources for this project.  

The goal is to perform an accurate and efficient Extract, Transfer, and Load (ETL) process before moving to a production database.    


## Data
* Yelp and GOOGLE API - restaurant information data

### Tools
* Python,  Jupyter Notebook, MongoDB. 

### Extract
* •    Retrieved the data sets from Yelp Fusion and Google API websites and submitted multiple API queries.  The scope of the data extraction was based on the inputted parameters in the API calls.
