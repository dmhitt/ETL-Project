# ETL-Project

## Restaurants - Information and Reviews

Weâ€™ve identified our datasets from Yelp and Google APIs as our data sources for this project.  

The goal is to perform an accurate and efficient Extract, Transfer, and Load (ETL) process.

We extracted: 
    *  Yelp restaurant information data
     * Yelp restaurant reviews data
     * Google restaurant information data 
     * Google restaurants reviews data

The data was reduced and transform to have only the essential information.

We used Jupyter Notebook and Python

The data was loaded into MongoDB.
